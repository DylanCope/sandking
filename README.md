# Sand-King

Sand-King is a developer agent system for interactively directing work across
local and SSH-hosted projects and delegating durable coding work to
project-adjacent agent harnesses.

The product is currently being specified through the
[Sand-King MVP Wayfinder map](https://github.com/DylanCope/sandking/issues/1).
This initial planning workspace preserves the known-good Sandcastle harness
used to develop the concept. Its safe bootstrap source is temporarily tracked
under `.sandcastle/`; credentials, databases, logs, and worktrees remain
ignored. The MVP design will determine how hosts generate untracked harnesses
for target projects.

Install the harness dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run its checks:

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm test
```

Start the bootstrap Sandcastle harness when the issue tracker has eligible
implementation work:

```bash
npm run sandcastle
```

Scope a run to one parent issue and all of its descendants:

```bash
npm run sandcastle -- --parent 25
```

The scoped run ignores eligible tickets outside that issue tree and stops once
GitHub reports the parent issue closed.

Launch the local Cockpit walking-skeleton slice:

```bash
npm run cockpit -- --no-open --json
```

This starts or reuses one loopback-only Controller runtime, prints a short-lived
bootstrap URL for the Cockpit, and negotiates with the local Host over the
framed stdio protocol. Stop the runtime with:

```bash
npm run cockpit:stop
```
